Tutorial:
The game is fairly simple. You will be prompted with a text prompt, then multible options on
different lines and each marked with ">". To select the option, enter the letter in
parentheses after the ">". For example:
######
Do you understand this tutorial?
>(a)Yes
>(b)No
######
To answer "Yes" to the question, you would enter "a" into the input box. To answer "No", you
would enter "b".

Sometimes, you will be asked a question, and you must type out the correct awnser instead of
awnsering a multible choice question. This will be marked with a "<" instead of a ">" and brackets
"[]" instaed of parentheses "()". For example:
######
Do you understand this tutorial?
<[free response, no caps]>
######
To this question, you would likely awnser "yes" or "no". As you may have noticed, notes/directions
will show up inside the brackets.
